/*
   The state variable encapsulates the all-over state of the system (ATTiny and RPi
   together).
   The possible states are:
    RUNNING_STATE      -   0 - the system is running normally
    UNCLEAR_STATE      -   1 - the system has been reset and is unsure about its state
    REC_WARN_STATE     -   2 - the system was in the warn state and is now recoveringe
    REC_SHUTDOWN_STATE -   4 - the system was in the shutdown state and is now recovering
    WARN_STATE         -   8 - the system is in the warn state 
    SHUTDOWN_STATE     -  16 - the system is in the shutdown state

    They are ordered in a way that allows to later check for the severity of the state by
    e.g., "if(state < SHUTDOWN_STATE)"

    This function implements the state changes between these states, during the normal
    execution but in the case of a reset as well. For this we have to take into account that
    the only information we might have is the current voltage and we are in the RUNNING_STATE.
